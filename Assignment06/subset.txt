### subset
#### Erin L. Keller
Subset is a function that pulls out data from the input object that meets the criteria of interest specified in the function. The input object can be vectors, data frames, and matrices and the arguments to be included are:
  * x - the object to be subsetted
  * subset - this is a logical expression where one specifies what elements to keep and to subset. Missing values are not included
  * select - an expression which indicates what columns to select from a data frame (only used for data frames and matrices)
  * drop - eliminates dimensions of an array that have only one level

The output to this function will be similar to the input object containing only the selected elements (vector) or rows/columns (matrix, data frame). It is important to note that some factors will have empty levels after subsetting and those that are unused will be removed.

```{r}
a <- matrix(c(runif(10, min = 80, max = 100),(runif(10, min=85, max = 115))),nrow=10,ncol=2)
colnames(a)<-c("MaxTemp2015","MaxTemp2017")
print(a)
subset(a, a[,1]>90 & a[,2]>100) # this will subset the original data matrix so that MaxTemp2015 will only diplay values over 90 while MaxTemp2017 will only display values greater than 100.
```
