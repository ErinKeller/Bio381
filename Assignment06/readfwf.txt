### read.fwf
#### Erin L. Keller

The purpose of read.fwf to to read a table of **f**ixed **w**idth **f**ormatted data into a data.frame. To use this function, you will need multiple arguments including:
  * the name of the file containing the data
  * the width of the fixed-dwitch fields in the form of a vector
  * a header containing a logical value specifying names of the variables
      * if this is present, the names of the variables must be delimited by sep
  * a character not used in the data set that will be the separator (sep)
  * row and column names (row.names and col.names)
  * n is the maximu number of lines to be included
  * skip can be used to identify how many rows should be skipped when reading the fwf file.
  * buffersize indicates the maximum number of lines to be read at one time (reducing this may reduce memory use when dealing with large files leading to faster processing)

The output of read.fwf will be a data frame as produced by read.table.

```{r}
x <- read.fwf(
  file=url("http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/wksst8110.for"),
  skip=4,
  widths=c(12, 7, 4, 9, 4, 9, 4, 9, 4))

head(x)

```
