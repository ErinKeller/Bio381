### +
#### Erin L. Keller

The + in R is used to indicate the addition of numbers as it is used in arithmetic. Using + is simple and only requires two values to be added together. Spaces between the values and the + are optional. The input value can be a vector, data frame, or matrix and the ouput value will be integers.

```{r}
a<-4.4
b<-1.2
c<-a+b
print(c)

d<-1:2
e<-d+1
print(e)
```
