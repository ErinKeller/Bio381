### Seq
#### Erin L. Keller
Seq is the function for sequence generation and is a standard generic function. The arguments  needed for this function are:
  * from, to - indicate what the starting and ending values of the sequence should be
  * by - the increment of the sequence (default = 1)
  * length.out - optional, the desired length of the sequence
  * along.with - takes the length from the length
  * : - can be used to create sequences of sequential numbers

The ouput for this function is a integer or double vector containing the desired sequence.
```{r}
Sequence <-seq(c(1:10,20:30,40:50)) # multiple sequences can be concatenated together to form one sequence
print(Sequence)
```
