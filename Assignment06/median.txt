### median
#### Erin L. Keller

The purpose of this function is to **calculate the median** value of a vector. The median value of a set of number is the value at the midpoint of the vector, so there are equal amounts of items on either side of the midpoint. In the case of a vector with an even number of values, the median function will take the average of the two midpoint values. The input for this function is a numerical vector and the ouput is an integer.

To use this function, you will need two arguments:   
* x - the numeric vector from which you want the median   
* na.rm - logial value specifying whether NA values should be included or discarded in the calculation   
  * na.rm = FALSE will not include NA values (default)   
  * na.rm = TRUE will include NA values   
  
  
```{r}
z <- 1:10
print(z)
median(z, na.rm=FALSE)

```
