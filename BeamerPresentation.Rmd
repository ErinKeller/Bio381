## Part I - Identifying Structure and Function

- Observe different structures of mammal skulls
- Propose claims about the life history of 4 species based on skull structure

## Terms
 
- “mandible” = lower jaw
- “orbit” = eye socket
- “fossa” = depression or hole
- “process” = outward projection
- “condyle” = a knob such as the ball of a ball and socket joint

## Important Muscles

 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}

## Blood Vessels 
- Skulls need depressions, channels, and canals for arteries and veins to allow for blood flow
- Alisphenoid canal found in some animals underneath upper jaw

 \end{picture}
 
## Eyes
- Eye orientation
  - Predators have forward-facing eyes
  - Prey have side-facing eyes
- Eye Size
  - Nocturnal species have larger

 ## Teeth
- The lifestyles of mammals require being able to capture, ingest, and digest food efficiently
  - Mammalian teeth have been modified to obtain and ingest food more efficiently

 \end{picture}
 
 ## Types of Teeth
 - Incisors
 - Canines
 - Premolars
 - Molars

 \put(00,50){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 
 ## Incisors
 - Thin teeth located at the front of the jaw
 - Used for slicing food

 \put(00,50){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 
 ## Canines
- Located right next to the incisors (if they have them!)
- Used for tearing food
 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(30,50){\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{Canines.jpg}}
 \put(00,50){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 
 ## Premolars and Molars
- Located behind canines
- Used for chewing, generally with multiple cusps (points)
- Only adults have molars!
  - Eutherians (placental mammals) have maximum of 4 premolars and 3 molars
  - Metatherians (marsupials)have a maximum of 3 premolars and 4 molars
  
 \begin{picture}(320,250)
 \put(30,50){\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{Molars.jpg}}
 \put(00,50){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
 \end{minipage}}
 \end{picture}
 
 ## Carnassials 
 
- Order Carnivora have these
- Specialized teeth which slide together to slice meat
- P^4^ and M^1^ = carnassial pair, overlap

## Note
\color{red} \huge These skulls are fragile and expensive!  Try not to handle them any more than you have to.  When you do pick them up, do so over a padded surface so in case they are accidentally dropped they will be less likely to break.
